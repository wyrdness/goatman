      "full": "Goatman is a cryptid/urban legend reported across multiple locations in the United States, most notably in Maryland, Texas, and Kentucky. Described as a hybrid creature with the upper body of a man and lower body of a goat, or a humanoid figure with goat-like features, the entity is typically portrayed as aggressive, attacking cars with axes, chasing people, and lurking near bridges and roads. The Maryland Goatman is associated with a popular origin story involving a scientist at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center whose experiments with goats went wrong, transforming him into the creature. The Texas version, sometimes called the Lake Worth Monster, was reported in 1969 with witnesses describing a white-haired goat-man. The Pope Lick Monster of Kentucky is associated with a railroad trestle and has a darker reputation involving deaths of people attempting to encounter it. The phenomenon shows clear connections to Greek satyr mythology and may have been influenced by satanic panic in the 1970s-80s. Theories range from urban legend and folklore to genuine cryptid to misidentified animals."

Legends vary: some say it uses hypnosis or voice mimicry to lure people onto the trestle to be hit by trains; others say it uses a bloody axe to kill trespassers. The creature is sometimes described as a reanimated circus freak or a farmer who sacrificed goats to Satan. The legend has tragically been associated with multiple deaths of people trespassing on the active railroad trestle.",
