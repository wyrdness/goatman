## Overview

Goatman is a cryptid/urban legend reported across multiple locations in the United States, most notably in Maryland, Texas, and Kentucky. Described as a hybrid creature with the upper body of a man and lower body of a goat, or a humanoid figure with goat-like features, the entity is typically portrayed as aggressive, attacking cars with axes, chasing people, and lurking near bridges and roads.

The Maryland Goatman is associated with a popular origin story involving a scientist at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center whose experiments with goats went wrong, transforming him into the creature. The Texas version, sometimes called the Lake Worth Monster, was reported in 1969 with witnesses describing a white-haired goat-man. The Pope Lick Monster of Kentucky is associated with a railroad trestle and has a darker reputation involving deaths of people attempting to encounter it.

The phenomenon shows clear connections to Greek satyr mythology and may have been influenced by satanic panic in the 1970s-80s. Most researchers consider Goatman a classic American urban legend with no basis in reality.
