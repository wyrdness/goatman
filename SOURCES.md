## Research Notes

### Methodological Concerns

Researchers examining Goatman phenomenon should note:

1. **No Physical Evidence**: Despite decades of reports and hundreds of alleged encounters, no physical evidence has ever been verified.

2. **Multiple Contradictory Origins**: Different locations have completely different and mutually exclusive origin stories, suggesting independent legend creation rather than genuine creature.

3. **Folklore Pattern Recognition**: Goatman follows classic urban legend structure:
   - Cautionary tale elements
   - Teenage thrill-seeking focus
   - Location-specific (bridges, roads, isolated areas)
   - Sexual/dating context (lovers lane)
   - Authority figure warnings (parents, police)

4. **Mythological Precedent**: Clear derivation from classical satyr mythology combined with Christian devil imagery, suggesting cultural transmission of archetypes rather than observed phenomenon.

5. **Temporal Patterns**: Peak activity coincides with satanic panic era (1970s-80s), suggesting cultural influence on legend development.

## Pope Lick Trestle Fatalities (Partial List)

⚠️ **Content Warning**: This section documents real deaths.

The Pope Lick Monster legend has resulted in multiple fatalities of people trespassing on the active railroad trestle. Known deaths include:

- 1988: First documented fatality
- 2016: Roquel Bain, filmmaker, killed by train
- 2019: Additional fatality
- Multiple other deaths and injuries documented

These deaths demonstrate the real-world danger of urban legend "legend-tripping" behavior.

## Ethical Note

While Goatman is widely considered an urban legend with no basis in reality, researchers should approach the topic with awareness of:

1. **Real Dangers**: The Pope Lick legend has caused real deaths
2. **Trespassing Laws**: Many Goatman locations involve illegal trespassing
3. **Responsible Reporting**: Avoid encouraging dangerous legend-tripping behavior
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect local communities and private property

This documentation presents Goatman as urban legend and folklore, which represents the scholarly consensus.
